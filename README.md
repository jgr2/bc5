BigCommerce Question 5 - Solution
=================================

	Here is my solution for question 5 of the tests
	supplied to me by BigCommerce, Sydney October 
	of 2013.

	The problem boils down to calculating the final 
	heading, in four degrees of movement, based on 
	a sequence of Left and Right values.

	My solution is all about removing redundancy in
	the sequence. Redundant sequences that occur are
	operations that negate eachother, eg. L then
	immediately R, after the subsequence we are back
	to where we started. Another sequence can be 
	translated to it's equivelent; LLL is equivelent
	to a single R, the same with the converse.

	I think that's enough verbosity.
